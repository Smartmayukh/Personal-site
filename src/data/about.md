# Intro

Hello, I am Mayukhmali Das. I am currently in my final year pursuing my B.E. degree in Electronics and Telecommunications from Jadavpur Univerisity, Kolkata, India.


# How I developed my research interest

I had a deep interest in Electronics while growing up. When I was 9 years old I had a home tutor, who also was an engineer at that time. He used to bring me various diodes, breadboards etc and used to teach me how to design ciruits. I still remember the first circuit I designed was  a full wave rectifier using diodes. My tutor hyped me up saying that the circuit I designed could charge a phone but as we all know that it is but a small part of a charging system. Thus at a very young age old I came across Mosfets and BJTs. I wanted to learn more. I wanted to decode the secrets of how things like the computer, the electric fan etc work. All this interest led me on the path to pursue my Bachelor’s of Engineering Degree in Electronics and Telecommunications. While studying in college, I also developed a keen interest and appreciation for Deep learning and Artificial Intelligence. I am very much grateful to get ample research opportunities in both of those fields.

# Research in Electronics :

I began my foray into Electronics research during my second year of college when one of my professors offered me the opportunity to work on RF Energy Harvesting circuits and relaying protocols. Together, we developed a groundbreaking hybrid-complementary Solar-RF Energy Harvesting system. During my summer internship, I focused on designing an Electromagnetic Energy Harvesting system specifically for vehicles like electric bikes. Building on my experience with RF and Electromagnetic Energy Harvesting, I delved into the world of FPGAs and ASICs, where I worked on the introduction of Hardware Trojans in SOC-based designs. As I approached my final year of college, my research interests shifted to wireless communication, with a particular focus on modulation schemes like OFDM. I  designed a complete OFDM transceiver system along with channel estimation. I am currently exploring OFDM jamming and the application of deep learning methodologies for the classification of different types of OFDM jamming. In addition to my research-related work, I have also participated in numerous tech fests across the country. During these events, I designed a range of projects, including RC planes, Arduino-controlled Sand Rovers, hydraulic arm-bearing RC cars, and Soccer-playing bots.

# Research in Artificial Intelligence :   

My first research work in AI was in my second year with some of my college seniors. We worked in Monocular Depth Estimation , generating Stereo images from Monocular Images and novel algorithms for depth estimation from stereo images. At this point of time, I was getting accustomed to Deep Learning and started studying NLP side by side with Computer Vision. I worked in Sentiment Analysis, Aspect Analysis and Unsupervised Text Classification. Now; previously I had a biology background in my high school. I also got selected for a Government Medical College. All this helped me to get an internship in Computational Biology in Carnegie Mellon University nearly midway through my second year. As they say the things you study never get wasted. Anyway, I worked on Covid 19 Cryo-ET data analysis. It was an extremely enriching experience. Following this journey ; in my third year, I started exploring various Neuromorphic architectures like Spiking Neural Networks and others. One such neuromorphic device called Event camera caught my attention. I started working on moving object detection in Event based vision and my paper on application of  k means clustering on Event based data got accepted in a conference. As I dived deeper in clustering, I started studying Graph Neural Networks. My final paper that got accepted was in EUSIPCO and the topic was reconstructing missing sensor data in wireless sensor networks. 

# Research in Optimization :

I also started to study about optimization in my second year. One of my papers on applying Reinforcement learning on Bee Swarm Optimization got accepted in EUROCON 2021. As my final year of college drew close, I steered towards application of optimization in circuit design.

# Future Goals :

At the moment, I feel more enthusiastic working in an interdisciplinary fashion. I feel that I can achieve my true potential when both of my skill sets in the domains of Electronics, Artificial Intelligence and Optimization constructively superimpose and amplify each other. As time goes on there is more and more incorporation of Artificial Intelligence in our everyday tech devices and thereby having a major impact on our lives. So it will be a great achievement for me if I am able to contribute to these ever growing field of technology.
