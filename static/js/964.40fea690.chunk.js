I am currently in my final year pursuing my B.E. degree in Electronics and Telecommunications from Jadavpur Univerisity, Kolkata, India.\n\n\n# How I developed my research interest\n\nI had a deep interest in Electronics while growing up. When I was 9 years old I had a home tutor who also was an engineer at that time. He used to bring me various diodes, breadboards etc and used to teach me how to design ciruits. I still remember the first circuit I designed was  a full wave rectifier using diodes. My tutor hyped me up saying that the circuit I designed could charge a phone but as we all know that it is but a small part of a charging system. Thus at a very young age old I came across Mosfets and BJTs. I wanted to learn more. I wanted to decode the secrets of how things like the computer, the electric fan etc work. All this interest led me on the path to pursue my Bachelor\u2019s of Engineering Degree in Electronics and Telecommunications. While studying in college, I also developed a keen interest and appreciation for Deep learning and Artificial Intelligence. I am very much grateful to get ample research opportunities in both of those fields.\n\n# Research in Electronics :\n\nMy research in Electronics started in my second year of college. One of my college professors gave me the opportunity to  work on RF Energy Harvesting circuits and relaying protocols. Currently we are building a novel hybrid - complementary Solar- RF Hybrid Energy Harvesting system. I was also involved in designing high-speed RF LNA and ADC in Cadence. The next research work was in my third year which dealt with LIDARS. I undertook this work right after my research paper on \u201c Monocular Depth Estimation \u201c was published. Building on the foundation in monocular and stereo depth estimation, I was able to design a semi-autonomous boat which mapped the depth of  water bodies using Bathymetric Lidars. It was around this same time that I started studying FPGAs , ASICs, and Memristor Crossbar Arrays. So my next work was mainly focused on deploying Neural Networks and DNN Accelerator using FPGAs. As my final year of college drew near I started working on wireless communication specifically ofdm. My specific focus was ofdm channel estimation using neural networks and desiging a complete wireless communication system using FPGAs. Last but not the least, as my summer internship project, I worked on Electromagnetic Energy Harvesting - designing commerciable energy harvesting models for bicycles. Besides research related work , I have had participated in numerous techfest across my country where I designed RC planes , Arduino controlled Sand rovers, Hydraulic Arm bearing RC cars and Soccer playing bots.\n\n# Research in Artificial Intelligence :   \n\nMy first research work in AI was in my second year with some of my college seniors. We worked in Monocular Depth Estimation , generating Stereo images from Monocular Images and novel algorithms for depth estimation from stereo images. At this point of time, I was getting accustomed to Deep Learning and started studying NLP side by side with Computer Vision. I worked in Sentiment Analysis, Aspect Analysis and Unsupervised Text Classification. Now; previously I had a biology background in my high school. I also got selected for a Government Medical College. All this helped me to get an internship in Computational Biology in Carnegie Mellon University nearly midway through my second year. As they say the things you study never get wasted. Anyway, I worked on Covid 19 Cryo-ET data analysis. It was an extremely enriching experience. Following this journey ; in my third year, I started exploring various Neuromorphic architectures like Spiking Neural Networks and others. One such neuromorphic device called Event camera caught my attention. I started working on moving object detection in Event based vision and my paper on application of  k means clustering on Event based data got accepted in a conference. As I dived deeper in clustering, I started studying Graph Neural Networks. My final paper that got accepted was in EUSIPCO and the topic was reconstructing missing sensor data in wireless sensor networks. \n\n# Research in Optimization :\n\nI also started to study about optimization in my second year. One of my papers on applying Reinforcement learning on Bee Swarm Optimization got accepted in EUROCON 2021. As my final year of college drew close, I steered towards application of optimization in circuit design.\n\n# Future Goals :\n\nAt the moment, I feel more enthusiastic working in an interdisciplinary fashion. I feel that I can achieve my true potential when both of my skill sets in the two domains of Electronics, Artificial Intelligence and Optimization constructively superimpose and amplify each other. As time goes on there is more and more incorporation of Artificial Intelligence in our everyday tech devices and thereby having a major impact on our lives. So it will be a great achievement for me if I am able to contribute to this new  ever growing field of technology. \n\n\n# Some of my Publications:\n                   \n- [Monocular Depth Estimation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9376365)\n- [Reinforced Swarm Optimization Algorithm](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9535639)\n- [Moving Object Detection for Event-based Vision using k-means Clustering](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9667636)\n- [Recovery of Missing Sensor Data by Reconstructing Time-varying Graph Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00418)\n\n# Some of my Articles:\n                   \n- [Cellular Automata and Verilog](https://sites.google.com/view/cellular-automata-mayukhmali/home)\n- [Lemmings Game using Verilog](https://sites.google.com/view/lemmings-verilog-mayukhmali/home)\n- [Simple Handwash Timer](https://www.hackster.io/Mayukhmali_Das/simple-handwash-timer-952c81)\n- [Covid 19 related projects](https://www.hackster.io/Mayukhmali_Das/covid-19-prevention-and-detection-ultimate-solution-160b87)\n\n\n# Some of my Achievements and activities\n\n- State Rank 16th with the percentage of 96.4 in Class 10 and State Rank 6th with the percentage of 98 in Class 12\n-  Recipient of Swami Vivekananda Merit-cum-Means Scholarship for a span of 4 years ( 2019 - 2023 )\n-  State Rank 1 in RKM Chemistry Entrance Exam and State Rank 4 in RKM Physics Entrance Exam\n-  All India Rank of 235 in NISER NEST\n-  Qualified for Dual Degree at IISER Kolkata\n-  General Merit Rank 228 in West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination\n-  State Rank of 1434 in NEET ( Medical Entrance Exam ); secured government medical college in the first round of counseling\n- First prize in Circuistics ( A Circuits Design Hackathon ) and Aboltabol 2.0 ( A competition where we had to propose new\nresearch ideas ) and Second prize in Spark Hack ( Hackathon for Innovation ) \u2013 all of the above were organized by the\nElectrical Engineering Department, Jadavpur University.
