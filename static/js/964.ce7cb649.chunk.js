I also advise startups, and I invest in people and ideas through a [small venture fund](https://skepticalinvestments.biz). I am particularly interested in projects that touch health and safety, imaging, social impact, and aerospace. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.\n\n# Currently\n\nAt Arthena, I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models with technologies like [Dask](https://dask.org/), [Dagster](https://dagster.io/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). I primarily work as a data engineer but have broad experience across Arthena\u2019s stack.\n\n# Some history\n\n- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 1993 when I was 3. It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were Street Rod 2, Wolfenstein 3D, and Tom and Jerry. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.\n\n- We subscribed to AOL in 1995. I still remember installing it from a floppy disk onto our brand new Packard Bell. It took years for me to send my first email.\n\n- In the summer of 1996, my uncle purchased [MegaRace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaRace) from [Media Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Play) and installed it on my mom's work computer. I might have endangered her business by using her computer too much.\n\n- At 7, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I also beat Minesweeper on expert for the first time.\n\n- At 8, my parents bought me a Sony Mavica MVC-FD71 digital camera after I stole their SLR one too many times. It could fit 10 images to a floppy disk at a 0.3MP resolution. I still have it and it still works. I've been taking photographs ever since, now with a Nikon D750, D800, and occasionally with a Mamiya 6II.\n\n- At 10, I built my first website with Microsoft FrontPage on our Pentium III [Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway,_Inc.). My website was terrible.\n\n- I was 11 when I built my first [Tesla Coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil) (without the permission of my parents). Over the next few years, I built several more including one of the first audio modulated coils and one of the first DRSSTCs.\n\n- When I was 12, I set the all-time high record at my local laser tag facility by reverse engineering the charging station and weapon protocols with a photo-resistor, micro-cassette recorder, and a lot of patience. I was unstoppable.\n\n- At 13, I went to space camp and fell in love. I went back two more times and promised myself that I'd work in space. I've since helped build three generations of satellites and have contributed to two more.\n\n- At 14, I was almost expelled for finding a backdoor into my high school's file server and telling everyone but the faculty members about it. Later that year, I figured out how to turn off the internet firewall by editing system registry keys. I anonymously shared my work months later.\n\n- At 16, I participated in a foreign exchange program in Dortmund, Germany. Since then, I've gone back almost every year.\n\n- 14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter Strike Source, Command and Conquer 3, Halo 2, and Age of Empires II.\n\n- At 18, In the summer before college, my friends and I started playing [Muggle Quidditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(sport)). We went on to start over 8 teams in the [International Quidditch Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Quidditch_Association) including the [Buffalo Quidditch Society](https://www.facebook.com/buffaloquidditch/). At our height, we were ranked third in the IQA. Although I don't play anymore, you can still see pictures of me holding a broom while wearing a chess camp t-shirt on facebook.\n\n- At 19, I took my first graduate course and published my first academic paper.\n\n- At 20, I co-authored a grant to build a satellite and managed a 60+ person team for the next two years. You can read more about that [here](https://ubnl.space/glados/).\n\nAsk me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.\n\n# I like\n\n- Running\n- Skiing\n- Sailing and the sea\n- Space\n- Summer\n- [Books](https://www.goodreads.com/mdangelo)\n- Colored pencils ([Faber-Castell Polychromos](https://www.faber-castell.com/products/art-and-graphic/polychromos))\n- Podcasts ([The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily), [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/), [The Indicator](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money), [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/), [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/episodes/), [The Economist](http://radio.economist.com/), [Radiolab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/radiolab), [Hidden Brain](https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain), [Inquiring Minds](https://inquiring.show), and others)\n- [Good design](/)\n- [Photography](https://instagram.com/dangelosaurus)\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- I am from originally from Buffalo, New York.
