I am currently in my final year pursuing my B.E. degree in Electronics and Telecommunications from Jadavpur Univerisity, Kolkata, India.\n\n\n# How I developed my research interest\n\nI had a deep interest in Electronics while growing up. When I was 9 years old I had a home tutor, who also was an engineer at that time. He used to bring me various diodes, breadboards etc and used to teach me how to design ciruits. I still remember the first circuit I designed was  a full wave rectifier using diodes. My tutor had expressed great enthusiasm, stating that the circuit had the potential to charge a phone. However, I later discovered that it was merely a small component within a more comprehensive charging system. Thus at a very young age old I came across Mosfets and BJTs. I wanted to learn more. All this interest led me on the path to pursue my Bachelor\u2019s of Engineering Degree in Electronics and Telecommunications. While studying in college, I also developed a keen interest and appreciation for Deep learning and Artificial Intelligence. I am very much grateful to get ample research opportunities in both of those fields.\n\n# Research in Electronics and Telecommunication:\n\nI began my foray into Electronics research during my second year of college when one of my professors offered me the opportunity to work on RF Energy Harvesting circuits and relaying protocols. Together, we developed a groundbreaking hybrid-complementary Solar-RF Energy Harvesting system. Next in my third year of college during my summer internship, I focused on designing an Electromagnetic Energy Harvesting system specifically for vehicles like electric bikes. Building on my experience with RF and Electromagnetic Energy Harvesting, I delved into the world of FPGAs and ASICs, where I worked on the introduction of Hardware Trojans in SOC-based designs. Corresponding paper has been published in the 2022 19th International SoC Design Conference (ISOCC). \n\n</br>\n\nAs I approached my final year of college, my research interests shifted to wireless communication, with a particular focus on modulation schemes like OFDM. I  designed a complete OFDM transceiver system along with channel estimation. I am currently exploring OFDM jamming and the application of deep learning methodologies for the classification of different types of OFDM jamming. Recently, I presented an exhibition on OFDM jamming at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in India. Now, In addition to my research-related work, I have also participated in numerous tech fests across the country. During these events, I designed a range of projects, including RC planes, Arduino-controlled Sand Rovers, hydraulic arm-bearing RC cars, and Soccer-playing bots.\n\n# Research in Artificial Intelligence :   \n\nMy first research work in AI was in my second year with some of my college seniors. We worked in Monocular Depth Estimation , generating Stereo images from Monocular Images and novel algorithms for depth estimation from stereo images. Corresponding paper entitled \u201cMonocular Depth Estimation Using Encoder-Decoder Architecture and Transfer Learning from Single RGB Image\u201d is published in 2020 IEEE 7th Uttar Pradesh Section International Conference on Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering (UPCON).  At this point of time, I was getting accustomed to Deep Learning and started studying NLP side by side with Computer Vision. I worked in Sentiment Analysis, Aspect Analysis and Unsupervised Text Classification. Following this journey; in my third year, I started exploring various Neuromorphic architectures like Spiking Neural Networks and others. One such neuromorphic device called Event camera caught my attention. I started working on moving object detection in Event based vision and my paper on application of k means clustering on Event based data got accepted in UPCON 2021. As I dived deeper in topics like clustering, I took an interest in Graph Neural Networks. One of my papers entitled  \u201c Recovery of Missing Sensor Data by Reconstructing Time-Varying Graph Signals\u201d was published in 2022 30th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO).\n\n\n# Research in Optimization :\n\nI also started to study about optimization in my second year. One of my papers on application of Reinforcement learning on Bee Swarm Optimization got accepted in EUROCON 2021. Currently I am working on application of optimization algorithms for efficient EEG electromagnet placement.\n\n# Future Goals :\n\nAt the moment, I feel more enthusiastic working in an interdisciplinary fashion. I feel that I can achieve my true potential when both of my skill sets in the domains of Wireless Communication and Artificial Intelligence constructively superimpose and amplify each other. As time goes on there is more and more incorporation of Artificial Intelligence in our everyday tech devices and thereby having a major impact on our lives. So it will be a great achievement for me if I am able to contribute to these ever growing field of technology. \n\n\n# Some of my Publications:\n                   \n- [Monocular Depth Estimation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9376365)\n- [Reinforced Swarm Optimization Algorithm](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9535639)\n- [Moving Object Detection for Event-based Vision using k-means Clustering](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9667636)\n- [Recovery of Missing Sensor Data by Reconstructing Time-varying Graph Signals](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9909940)\n- [Logic and Reduction Operation based Hardware Trojans in Digital Design](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10031413)\n\n\n# Some of my Articles related to SOC and Robotics :\n\n- [Advanced HDL](https://sites.google.com/view/advanced-hdl-mayukhmali-das/home)                \n- [Cellular Automata and Verilog](https://sites.google.com/view/cellular-automata-mayukhmali/home)\n- [Lemmings Game using Verilog](https://sites.google.com/view/lemmings-verilog-mayukhmali/home)\n- [Serial Communication using Verilog](https://sites.google.com/view/serial-comm-verilog-mayukhmali/home)\n- [Simple Handwash Timer](https://www.hackster.io/Mayukhmali_Das/simple-handwash-timer-952c81)\n- [Covid 19 related projects](https://www.hackster.io/Mayukhmali_Das/covid-19-prevention-and-detection-ultimate-solution-160b87)\n\n\n# Some of my Achievements and activities\n\n- State Rank 16th with the percentage of 96.4 in Class 10 and State Rank 6th with the percentage of 98 in Class 12\n-  Recipient of Swami Vivekananda Merit-cum-Means Scholarship for a span of 4 years ( 2019 - 2023 )\n-  State Rank 1 in RKM Chemistry Entrance Exam and State Rank 4 in RKM Physics Entrance Exam\n-  All India Rank of 235 in NISER NEST\n-  Qualified for Dual Degree at IISER Kolkata\n-  General Merit Rank 228 in West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination\n-  State Rank of 1434 in NEET ( Medical Entrance Exam ); secured government medical college in the first round of counseling\n-  Smart India Hackathon 2022 Finalist\n- First prize in Circuistics ( A Circuits Design Hackathon ) and Aboltabol 2.0 ( A competition where we had to propose new\nresearch ideas ) and Second prize in Spark Hack ( Hackathon for Innovation ) \u2013 all of the above were organized by the\nElectrical Engineering Department, Jadavpur University.
