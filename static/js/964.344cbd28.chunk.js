I am currently in my final year pursuing my B.E. degree in Electronics and Telecommunications from Jadavpur Univerisity, Kolkata, India.\n\n\n# My hobbies\n\n- Guitar\n- Gym\n- Karate\n- Muay Thai\n- Boxing\n- MMA\n- Basketball\n- Podcasts (Joe Rogan, Daily Stoic, Lex Fridman)\n\n# How I developed my research interest\n\nI had a deep interest in Electronics while growing up. From about 10 years old I used to make circuits using Mosfets and BJTs. That interest led me on my path to pursue my Bachelor\u2019s of Engineering Degree in Electronics and Telecommunications. While studying in college, I also developed a keen interest and appreciation for Deep learning and Artificial Intelligence. I am very much grateful to get ample research opportunities in this field. \n\n### Research in Artificial Intelligence :   \n\nMy first research work in AI was in my second year with some of my college seniors. We worked in Monocular Depth Estimation , generating Stereo images from Monocular Images and novel algorithms for depth estimation from stereo images. At this point of time, I was getting accustomed to Deep Learning and started studying NLP side by side with Computer Vision. I worked in Sentiment Analysis, Aspect Analysis and Unsupervised Text Classification. Now; previously I had a biology background in my high school. I also got selected for a Government Medical College. All this helped me to get an internship in Computational Biology in Carnegie Mellon University nearly midway through my second year. I am working on Covid 19 Cryo-ET data analysis. It is an extremely enriching experience. Following this journey ; in my third year, I started exploring various Neuromorphic architectures like Spiking Neural Networks and others. One such neuromorphic device called Event camera caught my attention. I started working on moving object detection in Event based vision and my paper on application of  k means clustering on Event based data got accepted in a conference. As I dived deeper in clustering, I started studying Graph Neural Networks and thus towards the mid of my third year, I undertook a work in disease prediction from Retinal Imaging where I used Graph Neural Networks.\n\n### Research in Electronics :   \n\nMy research in Electronics started in my second year of college. One of my college professors gave me the opportunity to  work on RF Energy Harvesting circuits and relaying protocols. Currently we are building an autonomous wheelchair which has inbuilt Solar- RF Hybrid Energy Harvesting and a complex sensor system which uses AI for depth mapping and obstacle avoidance. The next research work was in my third year which dealt with LIDARS. I undertook this work right after my research paper on \u201c Monocular Depth Estimation \u201c was published. Building on the foundation in monocular and stereo depth estimation, I was able to design a semi-autonomous boat which mapped the depth of  water bodies using Bathymetric Lidars. It was around this same time that I started studying FPGAs , CPLAs , ASICs, and Memristor Crossbar Arrays. So my next work is mainly focused on deploying Neural Networks and DNN Accelerator  using FPGAs and developing Spiking Neural Networks. Last but not the least I have also started working on designing wireless communication systems using FPGAs ; and  Anomaly Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks. Besides research related work , I have participated in numerous techfest across my country where I designed RC planes , Arduino controlled Sand rovers, Hydraulic Arm bearing RC cars and Soccer playing bots.\n\n### Future Goals :   \n\nAt the moment, I feel more enthusiastic working in an interdisciplinary fashion. I feel that I can achieve my true potential when both of my skill sets in the two domains of Electronics and Artificial Intelligence constructively superimpose and amplify each other.  I am determined to pursue a research career in  Electronics and Artificial Intelligence with the goal of applying for permanent positions in academic or industrial labs. As time goes on there is more and more incorporation of Artificial Intelligence in our everyday tech devices and thereby having a major impact on our lives. So it will be a great achievement for me if I am able to contribute to this new  ever growing field of technology. \n\n\n# Some of my Achievements and activities\n\n\u2022 State Rank 16th with the percentage of 96.4 in Class 10 and State Rank 6th with the percentage of 98 in Class 12\n<br/>\n\u2022 Recipient of Swami Vivekananda Merit-cum-Means Scholarship for a span of 4 years ( 2019 - 2023 )\n<br/>\n\u2022 State Rank 1 in RKM Chemistry Entrance Exam and State Rank 4 in RKM Physics Entrance Exam\n<br/>\n\u2022 All India Rank of 235 in NISER NEST\n<br/>\n\u2022 Qualified for Dual Degree at IISER Kolkata\n<br/>\n\u2022 General Merit Rank 228 in West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination\n<br/>\n\u2022 State Rank of 1434 in NEET ( Medical Entrance Exam ); secured government medical college in the first round of\ncounseling\n<br/>\n\u2022 First prize in Circuistics ( A Circuits Design Hackathon ) and Aboltabol 2.0 ( A competition where we had to propose new\nresearch ideas ) and Second prize in Spark Hack ( Hackathon for Innovation ) \u2013 all of the above were organized by the\nElectrical Engineering Department, Jadavpur University.
